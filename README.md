### even_odd_counter.py
A simple while loop project that takes a number range and counts how many numbers are even and how many are odd. Great for learning loops and conditional logic.

### number_guess_game.py
A fun beginner project where the user tries to guess a secret number using a `while` loop. The program gives feedback ("Too Big" / "Too Small") after each guess and counts how many attempts it took to get it right.
